I have a dog at home and just generally very fond of dogs. All the more excited was I when I came to discover that our parish house here in Bukene had a few dogs for protection at night.

Two of the dogs here are very dear to me now. Back when I came here, they were still very young, 6 months old at most. They were still growing pretty fast and back then, they still had the puppy eyes.

I have a lot of free time here, so sometimes I would go to them and try to go out on walks with them. In the beginning, they were quite shy and wouldn't even really let me touch them. Going out was especially difficult, they had never been out of their small 10 m2
enclosure.

### Dogs and the children

One problem is that people here have no idea how to handle dogs. Most adults do not and are scared of dogs, but children will actually try to scare the dogs away without them doing anything at all. Now, the problem is that my house is right next to the school, which means I can barely get out of the house without the children seeing the dogs.

When they do, they will start screaming, wave their arms and run around. One time I even had a kid throw stones at me and my dogs. For my dogs, which are generally rather shy to strangers, this is horrible. Soon, I started avoiding the children at all costs. As soon as I saw them when I was walking the dogs, I would change direction away from them. I also started letting go of the leash whenever contact was unavoidable as to not further scare my dogs when they wanted to get out of the situation.

It took a few months, but avoiding the stress turned out to be the right decision. Encounters with the children are relaxed most of the time now, although I still avoid the unneccesary stress if I can.

### Dogs in Tanzania

Most people here have no experience with dogs at all, not even talking about training them. That I walk the dogs here seems like a very strange thing to most people here. If people own dogs here, it's for protection, not for fun or enjoyment. Native people here don't treat dogs well. Most of them are locked away somewhere or just roam around freely during the day. I think keeping dogs inside the house is unheard of here.

Dog food is not a commodity to be found around here. If you want some, you have to go to one of the big cities like Dodoma or Dar es Salaam. Maybe in a few western supermarkets there, you may find it.

Dogs here, if they are fed at all, don't get to eat fish or meat. They get leftovers from rice, ugali or milk. Sometimes, they may also get a few leftover bones from the slaughtering of animals.

Training dogs is very uncommon here. Dogs are protection against thieves, giving them a name or taking proper care of them seems unneccesary to people here.
