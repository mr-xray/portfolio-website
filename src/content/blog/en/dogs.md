I have a dog at home and just generally very fond of dogs. All the more excited was I when I came to discover that our parish house here in Bukene had a few dogs for protection at night.

Two of the dogs here are very dear to me now. Back when I came here, they were still very young, 6 months old at most. They were still growing pretty fast and back then, they still had the puppy eyes.

I have a lot of free time here, so sometimes I would go to them and try to go out on walks with them. In the beginning, they were quite shy and wouldn't even really let me touch them. Going out was especially difficult, they had never been out of their small 10 m2
enclosure.

### Dogs and the children

One problem is that people here have no idea how to handle dogs. Most adults do not and are scared of dogs, but children will actually try to scare the dogs away without them doing anything at all. Now, the problem is that my house is right next to the school, which means I can barely get out of the house without the children seeing the dogs.

When they do, they will start screaming, wave their arms and run around. One time I even had a kid throw stones at me and my dogs. For my dogs, which are generally rather shy to strangers, this is horrible. Soon, I started avoiding the children at all costs. As soon as I saw them when I was walking the dogs, I would change direction away from them. I also started letting go of the leash whenever contact was unavoidable as to not further scare my dogs when they wanted to get out of the situation.

It took a few months, but avoiding the stress turned out to be the right decision. Encounters with the children are relaxed most of the time now, although I still avoid the unneccesary stress if I can.

### Dogs in Tanzania

Most people here have no experience with dogs at all, not even talking about training them. That I walk the dogs here seems like a very strange thing to most people here. If people own dogs here, it's for protection, not for fun or enjoyment. Native people here don't treat dogs well. Most of them are locked away somewhere or just roam around freely during the day. I think keeping dogs inside the house is unheard of here.

Dog food is not a commodity to be found around here. If you want some, you have to go to one of the big cities like Dodoma or Dar es Salaam. Maybe in a few western supermarkets there, you may find it.

Dogs here, if they are fed at all, don't get to eat fish or meat. They get leftovers from rice, ugali or milk. Sometimes, they may also get a few leftover bones from the slaughtering of animals.

Training dogs is very uncommon here. Dogs are protection against thieves, giving them a name or taking proper care of them seems unneccesary to people here.

### A snake almost killed my dog

Other than in Europe, snakes here are not that uncommon and often also very venomous. My female dog, Jane, had found snakes while on walks before and could always smell them. Some time back in November, at night, a black-necked spitting cobra accidentally entered the dogs' enclosure and could not find it's way out of there anymore.

After doing research on these snakes, they are actually huge and can reach 3m in length. They can spit venom from a few meters away and they usually target the eyes, which can damage them to the point of total blindness. Not only can they spit venom, they can also bite. Even to humans, they can be deadly, although mortality rate from this species is relatively low (5-10% for adult humans, according to Wikipedia), even if left untreated.

For my small puppy, however, a bite from this snake would most certainly kill it, but of course exactly that happended. I don't know where exactly the snake bit the dog, but juding from the missing fur and scarred skin around Jane's nose, that's where I would place my bet. Although I had heard the dogs bark wildly for some time, it was only when my parish priest Fr. Siljo called me out that I knew what was going on.

I heard that some workers had tried to kill the snake by throwing stones at it, but it escaped back out of the enclosure into the garden. People searched for the snake in our garden for days, but it was never seen again. When I got out of the house and to the dogs, Jane was already laying down on the ground only quietly squeaking, mouth covered in foam and vomit everywhere. I stayed there with her until the squeaking stopped; I thought it was over. Naturally, I went to bed very sad that night.

The next morning, I didn't even want to go there to pick up the dead dog. But against all odds, Jane had made it over the night. She still struggeled with walking and had to lay down after a few steps, but she was truly alive. Now, in Europe, at this point the fight would be over: The dog is at the vet and will surely recover.

But for me now, this was the time I really started to struggle. There are no vets here in Bukene, and if there were, surely they could not give the dog an IV for recovery. Jane was alive, but very weak. Every 15 minutes or so, still intoxicated, she would vomit, although nothing was left to vomit. She didn't drink, didn't eat, and it was blazingly hot at >30Â°C. The worst part was that there was nothing I could do. Either she would make it on her own, or die from exhaustion. She would go to the water bowl, visibly thirsty, but could not drink from it. Only the next day I was finally relieved, when she ate an egg that I offered to her. But the time up until that point was absolutely nerve-racking for me.
