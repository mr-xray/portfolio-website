Other than in Europe, snakes here are not that uncommon and often also very venomous. My female dog, Jane, had found snakes while on walks before and could always smell them. Some time back in November, at night, a black-necked spitting cobra accidentally entered the dogs' enclosure and could not find it's way out of there anymore.

### Black-necked spitting cobra

After doing research on these snakes, they are actually huge and can reach 3m in length. They can spit venom from a few meters away and they usually target the eyes, which can damage them to the point of total blindness. Not only can they spit venom, they can also bite. Even to humans, they can be deadly, although mortality rate from this species is relatively low (5-10% for adult humans, according to Wikipedia), even if left untreated.
<br><br>
For my small puppy, however, a bite from this snake would most certainly kill it, but of course exactly that happended. I don't know where exactly the snake bit the dog, but juding from the missing fur and scarred skin around Jane's nose, that's where I would place my bet.

### How it went down

Although I had heard the dogs bark wildly for some time that night, it was only when my parish priest Fr. Siljo called me out that I knew what was going on.
<br><br>
I heard that some workers had tried to kill the snake by throwing stones at it, but it escaped back out of the enclosure into the garden. People searched for the snake in our garden for days, but it was never seen again. When I got out of the house and to the dogs, Jane was already laying down on the ground only quietly squeaking, mouth covered in foam and vomit everywhere. I stayed there with her until the squeaking stopped; I thought it was over. Naturally, I went to bed very sad that night.
<br><br>
The next morning, I didn't even want to go there to pick up the dead dog. But against all odds, Jane had made it over the night. She still struggeled with walking and had to lay down after a few steps, but she was truly alive. Now, in Europe, at this point the fight would be over: The dog is at the vet and will surely recover.
<br><br>
But for me now, this was the time I really started to struggle. There are no vets here in Bukene, and if there were, surely they could not give the dog an IV for recovery. Jane was alive, but very weak. Every 15 minutes or so, still intoxicated, she would vomit, although nothing was left to vomit. She didn't drink, didn't eat, and it was blazingly hot at >30Â°C. The worst part was that there was nothing I could do. Either she would make it on her own, or die from exhaustion. She would go to the water bowl, visibly thirsty, but could not drink from it. Only the next day I was finally relieved, when she ate an egg that I offered to her. But the time up until that point was absolutely nerve-racking for me.
<br><br>
After a few more days, after Jane had recovered, I went on my first walk with her again, she was truly excited. She fully recovered.
Still, to this day, you can see that she had a rough time. She is smaller, weaker and has very bad fur compared to her brother Jack.
