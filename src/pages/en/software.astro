            <h1>Coding as a hobby</h1>
            <p>
              For my 5 high school years, I studied computer science in school.
              My strength lies in Web-Development, whether that be frontend with
              Angular and Typescript, backend with Java-Spring or databases such
              as Oracle or MongoDB.
              <br /><br />Here is a selection of my different projects!
            </p>
            <br />

            Over the years, I have come in contact with many programming
            languages, principles and technologies. Here are the ones I deem
            most relevant.

        This is my selection of projects, together with GitHub source code
        links.<br /> Most of my projects were school-assignments, unfit to be shown
        to the public. These ones, however, are pretty nice.<br /> Tell me what you
        think!
